We performed following activities:
1. Understood the problem
2. Imported required libraries and their use
3. Imported data and learned its structure
4. Performed basic EDA
5. Scaled different variables
6. Outlier treatment
7. Built basic Classification model with Random Forest
8. Nearmiss technique for undersampling data
9. SMOTE for oversampling data
10. cross validation in the context of undersampling and oversampling
11. Pipelining with sklearn/imblearn
12. Applying Linear model: Logistic Regression
13. Applying Ensemble technique: Random Forest
14. Applying Non Linear Algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and k-Nearest Neighbour
15. Making predictions on test set and computing validation metrics
16. ROC curve and Learning curve
17. Comparison of results and Model Selection
18. Visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
